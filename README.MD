# FORGESCAN REALSENSE WRAPPER

## Dependencies

The RViz visualization depends on motoman support packages, please configure the scene.urdf.xacro with a desired robot.

The current setup works with the [motorman_ms210_support] (https://github.com/EricMarcil/motoman/tree/GP225) package found in Eric Marcil's repo.

Please note that this requires [motoman_resources] (https://github.com/OSU-AIMS/aims-robots-all) which is found internally in aims-robots-all
