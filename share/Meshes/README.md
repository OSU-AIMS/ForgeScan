# Meshes

This folder is the default location where the project will search for meshes to load into the program. 

## Files from the ABC Dataset.

To more easily demonstrate ForgeScan with interesting geometries, the first ten items of the [ABC dateset](https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/)[^1]
are included with this project. Their notable features and the corresponding full ABC file name are included
in the table below.

| File Name               | Challenging reconstruction features                | ABC Filename                                      |
