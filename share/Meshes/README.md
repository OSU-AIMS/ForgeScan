# Meshes

This folder is the default location where the project will search for meshes to load into the program. 

## CAD Files.

Several STL files from CAD models, common 3D test models, and hand-generated meshes of real parts are
included in this project. They are used for both examples and experiments. 

| File Name                            | Description                                                                      |
| ---                                  | ---                                                                              |
| [sphere.stl](./sphere.stl)           | Origin centered sphere of diameter `PI/8`.                                       |
| [box.stl](./box.stl)                 | Origin centered box od dimensions `PI/4`, `PI/6`, `PI/5`.                        |
| [bin.stl](./bin.stl)                 | Same as `box`, but with a rectangular cut `0.4` deep on the positive-Y face. Wall thickness of `0.02`, `0.05`, `0.1,` and `0.2`.       |
| [bunny.stl](./bunny.stl)             | Stanford bunny, a common 3D test model. This model is sourced from Makerbot[^1]. |
| [rotor_blade.stl](./rotor_blade.stl) | Scan of a turbine engine rotor blade. Generated by a Creaform HandySCAN. This is a large mesh with `814K` vertices and `1,628k` faces. |


## Files from the ABC Dataset.

To more easily demonstrate ForgeScan with interesting geometries, the first ten items of the [ABC dateset](https://deep-geometry.github.io/abc-dataset/)[^2]
are included with this project. Their notable features and the corresponding full ABC file name are included
in the table below.

| File Name               | Challenging reconstruction features                | ABC Filename                                      |
