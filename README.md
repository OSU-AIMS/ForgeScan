# Forge Scan

The Forge Scan project is targeted for autonomous sensing in environments requiring quick, iterative, and approximate or focused geometric measurements using vision sensors. Based on a user's configuration, this project will generate a computation representation and autonomously select the next best view until the representation is satisfactory. The system will utilize any prior information provided and users may specify areas which require particular attention.

This project is still in early development and subject to major changes. Consider is pre-alpha.
